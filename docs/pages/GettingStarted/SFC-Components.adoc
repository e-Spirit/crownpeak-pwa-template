= Writing Single File Components

:moduledir: ../..
:imagesdir: {moduledir}/images

In this section we will be exploring how to go about implementing a Teaser section using the classic Vue single file components.

When you go to the page `/unsere-loesungen` in the development mode, you will see that multiple components are displayed as unknown.

By clicking on the question mark on one of the unknown component the dev info tells us that there should be a component of type `Section`. We can also see that the 'sectionType' property of this missing section is called `teaser`.

Our section components are located in `~/components/Section/`. That's where you want to create a new file for the component.

We name our new file `Teaser.vue` and add a template tag to the file so we can see something when we fire up the dev server:

[source,xml]
----
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Teaser Component</h1>
  </div>
</template>
----

Now we need to reference our newly created teaser component inside the general `Section.vue` component which can be found in the `~/components/PageBodyContent/` directory. 

Simply add a `teaser` case to the computed `sectionComponent` property. Make sure to name the case after the respective `sectionType` and name the component that is going to be resolved according to the path where it is located. In this case `Section/Teaser.vue` becomes `SectionTeaser`. As of now, the component name needs to be a hardcoded string. Variable component resolving is not yet possible in Nuxt 3.

[source,ts]
----
// ~/components/PageBodyContent/Section.vue

...
const sectionComponent = computed(() => {
  switch (props.content.sectionType) {
    case "teaser":
      return resolveComponent("SectionTeaser");
    default:
      return resolveComponent("Unknown");
  }
});
...
----


When we go back to the browser, instead of the unknown component we should see our component.

Our component is recognized correctly. But we still do not display the data from the https://docs.e-spirit.com/module/caas/CaaS_FSM_Documentation_EN.html[CaaS] in our component.
For that we hover over our component and click on the appearing question mark on the right side again.

This shows us the data available to display.
For the first example we want to display the `st_jumbo_headline`. Your section has access to a `data` property that gets passed to your component. You can make this property typesafe by adding a custom interface. Modify the `Teaser.vue` component like this:

[source,xml]
----
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Teaser Component: {{ data.st_jumbo_headline }}</h1>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
interface Teaser {
  st_jumbo_headline:string
}
defineProps<{ data: Teaser }>();
</script>
----

The result should look like this:

To render richtext, image or button elements you can use the `RichText.vue`, `Image.vue` and `Button.vue` components which can be found under the `~/components/Elements/` folder. Use them like this in your teaser component:

[source,xml]
----
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Teaser Component: {{ data.st_jumbo_headline }}</h1>
    <ElementsRichText :richtext="data.st_headline" />
    <ElementsImage :image="data.st_picture" :alt="data.st_picture_alt" />
    <ElementsButton :button="data.st_button" @button-click="clickHandler" />
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { Image, RichTextElement } from "fsxa-api";

interface Teaser {
  st_jumbo_headline:string
  st_headline: RichTextElement[];
  st_picture?: Image;
  st_picture_alt?: string;
  st_button: MyCustomButtonInterface
}
defineProps<{ data: Teaser }>();


function clickHandler(){
  // do sth.
}
</script>
----

Of course you can modify all components and adjust them according to your specific requirements. In our implementation example `ElementsButton` emits a `buttonClick` event which can be hooked into with `@button-click`. Simply define your click handler function inside the script tag as shown above.
