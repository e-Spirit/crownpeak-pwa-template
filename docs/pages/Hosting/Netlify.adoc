The Introduction#Deployment chapter describes how to create and run the PWA template in a container. This is a good approach, which could also be used in production setups, but it does not fully utilize the capabilities of the Nuxt 3 framework.

This section describes a serverless hosting solution based on our recommended hoster Netlify. It includes a detailed guide explaining how to create a PWA template deployment in a few steps.

== Introduction
//TODO: link to edge functions
Our reference PWA Template can be hosted very easily.
Particularly good performance is achieved when the application uses Edge Functions.
We recommend Netlify as a hosting partner, as the worldwide performance is particularly good here.
Netlify is a cloud-based platform that simplifies and automates the process of deploying and managing websites and web applications. It offers a comprehensive set of tools and services that enable developers to build, deploy, and scale their projects quickly and efficiently.
In this chapter we will explain step by step how our reference project on Github can be hosted on Netlify.

== Preconditions
//TODO: replace URLs and Product names
In order to follow the guide below without any problems, there are some preconditions that must be met.

== Initial Setup Guide

=== Fork Repository

=== Create & Configure Site
This chapter lists items that are necessary to create a site on Netlify.

. Click on `Deploy with GitHub` (compare <<fig_deploy_from_github>>)
. You need to `Authorize Netlify` to see what GitHub resources (e.g. which repositories) you have access to

. Now you can configure your GitHub account to allow Netlify deployments for specific repositories - Select at least your PWA Template fork

. After you have pressed `Install` you can deploy your PWA Template fork to Netlify
. You should see a view like in this screenshot

. Change the _Publish directory_ to `dist` - Other parameters can use the default value
. Click on `Deploy my-pwa-template` to initiate the first build
. After a while you should see a successfully _Published_ build like in the picture below
