The Introduction#Deployment chapter describes how to create and run the PWA template in a container. This is a good approach, which could also be used in production setups, but it does not fully utilize the capabilities of the Nuxt 3 framework.

This section describes a serverless hosting solution based on our recommended hoster Netlify. It includes a detailed guide explaining how to create a PWA template deployment in a few steps.

== Introduction
//TODO: link to edge functions
Our reference PWA Template can be hosted very easily.
Particularly good performance is achieved when the application uses Edge Functions.
We recommend Netlify as a hosting partner, as the worldwide performance is particularly good here.
Netlify is a cloud-based platform that simplifies and automates the process of deploying and managing websites and web applications. It offers a comprehensive set of tools and services that enable developers to build, deploy, and scale their projects quickly and efficiently.
In this chapter we will explain step by step how our reference project on Github can be hosted on Netlify.
