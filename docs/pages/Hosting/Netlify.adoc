The xref:docs/pages/Introduction.adoc#deployment[Deployment] chapter describes how to create and run the PWA template in a container.
This is a good approach, which could also be used in production setups, but it does not fully utilize the capabilities of the https://nuxt.com[Nuxt 3] framework.

This section describes a serverless hosting solution based on our recommended hoster https://www.netlify.com[Netlify].
It includes a detailed guide explaining how to create a PWA template deployment in a few steps.

== Introduction
Our reference PWA Template can be hosted very easily.
Particularly good performance is achieved when the application uses https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/overview/[Edge Functions].
We recommend Netlify as a hosting partner, as the worldwide performance is particularly good here.
Netlify is a cloud-based platform that simplifies and automates the process of deploying and managing websites and web applications. It offers a comprehensive set of tools and services that enable developers to build, deploy, and scale their projects quickly and efficiently.
In this chapter we will explain step by step how our reference project on Github can be hosted on Netlify.

== Preconditions
In order to follow the guide below without any problems, there are some preconditions that must be met.

. A https://github.com/[GitHub] account is required
. Access to content in https://docs.e-spirit.com/module/caas-platform/CaaS_Platform_Documentation_EN.html[FirstSpirit CaaS] is required
. Matching data in https://navigationservice.e-spirit.cloud/docs/user/en/documentation.html[Navigation Service] is required

== Initial Setup Guide
After this guide, you are the owner of your own PWA Template repository which builds are hosted in Netlify.
If you are missing contextual information to any step, you might find it here https://docs.netlify.com/get-started/.
The following button will deploy a PWA template instance on Netlify, streamlining the onboarding process for web developers and making it easier for them to get started. You can use it and continue to the guide at chapter <<Configure and deploy Site>>.

=== Fork Repository
. Navigate to https://github.com/e-Spirit/crownpeak-pwa-template/fork
. Login with your https://github.com/[GitHub] credentials
. Select an owner and a repository name for your fork
. You only need to fork the main branch, so keep this checkbox selected

=== Create & Synchronize Netlify Account
After these steps, you will have a https://www.netlify.com[Netlify] account, that is linked to your GitHub account.

. Navigate to https://www.netlify.com and click to sign up
. Select `Sign up with GitHub` and (login with your credentials, if required)
. Authorize Netlify to access your https://github.com/[GitHub] account

=== Create Site
This chapter lists items that are necessary to create a site on https://github.com/[GitHub].

. Click on `Deploy with GitHub` (compare <<fig_deploy_from_github>>)
. You need to `Authorize Netlify` to see what GitHub resources (e.g. which repositories) you have access to
image:03-read-github-permission.png[GitHub read permissions]
. Now you can configure your GitHub account to allow Netlify deployments for specific repositories - Select at least your PWA Template fork
image:06-install-netlify-for-repos.png[Install Netlify for repositories]
. After you have pressed `Install` you can deploy your PWA Template fork to Netlify
. You should see a view like in this screenshot
image:08-build-settings.png[Build settings]
. Change the _Publish directory_ to `dist` - Other parameters can use the default value
. Click on `Deploy my-pwa-template` to initiate the first build
. After a while you should see a successfully _Published_ build like in the picture below
image:09-overview.png[Site Overview]

At this point the site for your fork has been created, but it is still missing a working runtime configuration.
The next chapter will cover the last steps.

=== Configure and deploy Site
. Open the `Site configuration` view of
. Your build is using no runtime configuration - You can change this in _Site configuration_ -> _Environment variables_ -> _Add a variable_ -> _Import from a .env file_
image:10-add-variable.png[Add environment variables]
. Paste the content of the fork's .env file the matching input field and click `Import variables`
. To get the values for your .env file, you can follow xref:docs/pages/Configuration.adoc[Configuration] chapter
image:11-import-env.png[Import environment variables]
. The changed configuration needs to be rolled out - Navigate to `Deploys`
. Click on `Trigger deploy`
image:13-redeploy.png[Site deploys]
. When the deployment finished successfully, you should be able to `Open production deploy`

Now you have created a site for your PWA template.
You can use it as a playground or as a foundation for a company scale hosting solution.
