== Introduction

This page is an overview over the various site configuration options netlify offers. 
We will go over the environment variables needed to deploy the PWA template as the configuration is already covered by the https://docs.netlify.com/[netlify documentation].
We will also go over the continuous deployment configuration as it will be needed for mapping the various deployment stages (dev/qa/prod) of your FirstSpirit Projects to Netlify sites.
We recommend using at least two sites one for edit or preview mode and one for release mode (as defined by the <<MODE>> environment variable).
You can model all of the stages using the netlify continuous deployment configurations in conjunction with setting the environment variables for each deployment context individually.

The mapping relies on the deploy preview feature of netlify.
It deploys a preview of the site whenever a pull request is made against the production branch or selected branches.
If you add for example a staging branch to the list of branches to deploy as part of the site configuration you will get a preview deployment of the site whenever a pull request is made against the staging branch.
So in order to set up your dev stage you can configure your deploy previews to use data from the development environment.
If you add staging specific environment variables to the staging branch deployment context you've got your staging stage covered.
And finally if you add production specific environment variables to the production branch deployment context you've got your production stage set up.

[WARNING]
====
Keep in mind that a pull request from staging to production will trigger a deploy preview using a development environment. 
Unfortunately there is no other way to set this up as netlify only allows one set of variables for the deploy preview deployment context.

== Continuous Deployment

We recommend setting the following properties here
- Production branch: This property states which branch should be used to deploy the site. 
This should be set to your main branch on github. 
Or whichever branch contains your production level code.
- Branch deploys: Allows to define whether any branches on github should also deployed as part of this site. 
You can add individual branches to be deployed (eg. staging). 
We would recommend adding your staging or qa branch to the list of individual branches.
- Deploy previews: A preview is deployed when a pull request is made against the production branch 
and redeployed whenever a new commit gets pushed onto the branch. 
Deploy previews are not only useful because they let you test your current development branch in the netlify environment.
They provide access to some of githubs collaboration tools as an overlay when visiting the deployed PWA.
You can read more about the continuous deployment configuration options https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/overview/[here].

== Environment Variables

You can and should use different environment variables for different deployments. 
To edit environment variables choose edit from the dropdown menu in the top right corner of a variable subsection.

Next you can choose from various configuration options.

Keep in mind that if you want to map your FirstSpirit project stages to the different deployment 
contexts of netlify you need to choose the option "Different value for each deploy context" for most of your environment variables.

=== NITRO_PRESET

You can use this variable to deploy the site using netlify edge functions.
In order to do this, set this variable to `netlify-edge`.
Edge functions are considerably faster than normal functions but have a tighter restriction on app performance.
You can read all about these limits in the https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/limits/[netlify docs]

=== MODE

Set to `preview` the site will be deployed to pull data from the preview caas. 
This is the site that contains and displays all the live data during editing.
Set to `release` the site will be deployed to pull data from the released content. 
This variable should be set to the same value over all deployment contexts to avoid confusion.
We recommend using sites to separate these two modes and name your sites accordingly.
The main reason is that you cannot configure a site on netlify to generate two different deployments from the same branch.

=== Other Variables

Of the other environment variables the following are the ones that need to be set individually for each deployment context.

- SNAP_URL
- NAVIGATION_SERVICE
- CAAS
- PROJECT_ID
- API_KEY
