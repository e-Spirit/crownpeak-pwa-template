== Introduction

The FSXA-PWA features a development mode that helps you to easily map the content coming from the CaaS to your components.

To enable the development mode, the variable `devMode` must be set to `true` in the `app.config.ts` file. This file is also checked into git. So be sure to change the variable back to `false` before deploying to production. Alternatively you can enable devMode by setting the `FSXA_DEV_MODE` environment variable.

== Missing Components

If you are in development mode and a component on the page has not been developed yet, a `unknown` compoent is rendered. By hovering it and clicking on the question mark you can see exactly which component is missing and what information can be addressed.
